# ForgeCMS üõ†Ô∏è
## Project Overview
ForgeCMS is a Lua-based Content Management System (CMS) designed for private World of Warcraft servers, operating under TrinityCore. 
Leveraging technologies such as LuaJIT, LuaRocks, and Lapis, ForgeCMS follows the HMVC design pattern to provide a robust and modular system for managing server content.

## Features üöÄ
- **Basic CMS Functionality:** ForgeCMS offers essential features expected from a CMS tailored for World of Warcraft servers, including news management, user registration, login, voting system, and an integrated store.
- **Discord Webhook Integration:** ForgeCMS offers native integration with Discord Webhooks, enabling seamless communication between the CMS and Discord servers.
- **Future Planned Features:**
    - **Integration with Eluna:** ForgeCMS plans to establish communication with Eluna, enhancing gameplay interaction and functionality.
    - **Gamification:** Efforts will be made to gamify the website experience, encouraging users to spend more time on the platform.
    - **Player Character Management:** Users will gain control over their in-game characters, allowing for management of inventories, auctions, and related aspects.
    - **Analytics Tools:** ForgeCMS aims to implement various tools to track important metrics such as player averages, account creation statistics, login trends, and more.
